<p>What are E-sims and How does it work?</p>

<p>

<h4>
<p> 
An eSIM is an embedded SIM – an electronic alternative to a physical, plastic SIM card – that connects your mobile phone to a mobile network, allowing you to make calls, send texts, and use the internet. 

With an embedded SIM (eSIM), you can choose and activate a mobile plan from your service provider without needing to order and insert a physical SIM into your phone. You can install eight or more eSIMs on compatible devices and have two phone numbers at the same time.  

Unlike existing SIM cards, an eSIM is a specific piece of code embedded into the device itself and cannot be removed and put in another phone or tablet.

As technology advances, eSIMs are becoming increasingly popular, as they enhance the user experience and are ideal for activities such as using your phone abroad.

The availability of eSIMs is growing rapidly in the UK, and with Apple starting to phase out physical SIM cards on iPhones in more countries, it may soon become the primary method for activating phone contracts.
